# Travel Buddy https://karltunmoreno.github.io/travel_buddy/
* GIVEN there are international tourists in many cities, the weather and currency exchange rate may influence their attire, activities, and budget.
​
## Description of the MVP
​
* WHEN the user inputs a city, they are presented with the weather for that day and a five day forecast.
* WHEN the user selects from a drop down menu of currencies, the user sees its value compared to one US dollar.
* WHEN the user inputs the cost of something in US Dollars, the user sees the value in the selected currency.
​
## Project Requirements as a Description
​
### Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
    * Materialize has been implemented with custom css support files
        * Basic styling via HTML shortcuts sim. to Bootstrap
        * Difficult to finesse
​
### Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
    * See our website
        * Early deployment helped us scale back MVP scope
        * Loading time is a problem 
​
### Be interactive and use at least two server-side APIs
    * The user inputs any major city in the world.
        * Weather information is in "real time".
        * For mor information see https://openweathermap.org/api
    * The user can select from a list of 51 currencies.
        * Exchange rate information is in "real time".
        * For more information see https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/overview
​
### Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
    * Incorporating modals is on our wish list for future development.
        * Asking the user allowance for their current location:
            * Recommend activities based upon the local weather
            * Recommend retail items based upon the local weather
        * Asking the user where they want to go:
            * Sign up for Travel Buddy
                * Ask if they are interested in receiving last minute trip deals.
                * Ask if they want to receive "staycation" deals.
​
### Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
    * The last city searched is stored locally.
​
### Be responsive and have a polished UI.
    * We were happy with our bootstrap CSS look and feel, and hope to materialize it as best as possible.
    * The CDN provided CSS options will make it easier to scale projects.
​
### Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards:
    * We have tried to implement the following to the best of our ability:
        * file structure
        * naming conventions
        * follows best practices for class/id naming conventions
        * indentations and quality comments
​
### Have a quality README
    * We have tried to implement the following to the best of our ability:
        * unique name and description
        * technologies used
        * screenshot, and link to deployed application
